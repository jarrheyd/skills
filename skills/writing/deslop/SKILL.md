# Deslop Skill — Copy Quality Gate

A quality gate that catches AI-generated writing before it ships: the words, phrases, and structures that read as machine-written. Primary use is copy and prose, which is what the auto-hook, the humanizer, and the detector all target. It also keeps slop catalogs for UI, images, social, video, and websites as a secondary checklist, but for interface and visual-design work, reach for the impeccable skill instead.

This is not a style guide. It's a bullshit detector.

## Why This Exists

"Slop" was Merriam-Webster's 2025 Word of the Year. It means AI-generated content that's technically competent but soulless, generic, and statistically average. The root cause: AI outputs converge toward the mean of training data, producing the most probable output every time. A fintech hero section looks identical to a project management tool's. A LinkedIn post reads like every other LinkedIn post. An AI headshot has the same plastic skin as every other AI headshot.

The antidote is not "don't use AI." It's **specificity, intentionality, and human fingerprints.**

## Activation

### 1. PreToolUse Hook (Automatic)

`hooks/copy_slop_hook.py` runs on every Write/Edit to files containing prose: `.md`, `.mdx`, `.txt`, `.tsx`/`.jsx` (string literals), `.html`. It catches:

| Signal | What's Caught | Action |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Banned words (high density) | "delve," "leverage," "tapestry," "synergy," "holistic" at >1 per 500 words | **Warn** |
| Banned phrases | "In today's fast-paced," "It's not just X, it's Y," "Unlock the power of" | **Block** |
| Em dash abuse | More than 1 em dash per 300 words | **Warn** |
| Sycophantic openers | "Great question!", "Absolutely!", "I love that idea!" | **Block** |
| Hedging soup | "On one hand... on the other hand" in same paragraph | **Warn** |
| Uniform paragraph length | All paragraphs within 15% of same word count | **Warn** |
| Filler transitions | "Furthermore," "Moreover," "It's worth noting that" | **Warn** |
| Rhetorical-question pile-ups | Two or three short questions stacked with no answer ("Top? Bottom? Both?") | **Block** |
| Two-word wisdom closers | "Worth it.", "It tracks.", "Math checks out." as final lines | **Warn** |
| Inline section-headers in prose | "The question:" / "The setup:" / "The result:" used as pseudo-headers | **Warn** |
| Hyphenated-compound titles | "the-position-of-the-rule test", "the-AI-that-can-promote-itself" — over-compounded noun phrases | **Warn** |
| "Not X. Not Y." rhythm | Three-beat negation ladders ("Not 95. Not 98. Fifty for fifty.") | **Warn** |
| Generic abstract metaphors | "wherever it lives", "the right lever", "the missing piece", "moves the needle" | **Warn** |
| Either-or reductive framing | "Either it matches or it doesn't.", "Either X or Y." used to compress a finding | **Warn** |
| Triple-comma cadence | "specific, careful, deliberate" / three adjectives in series with no fourth | **Warn** |
| "Honestly" / "Genuinely" tics | Used as opening words for emphasis | **Block** |
| "Real talk" / "I'll be honest" | Manufactured-candor openers | **Block** |
| "X but make it Y" framing | The TikTok-aphorism pattern | **Block** |
| "Hits different" | The 2022 phrase that's now AI's favorite | **Block** |
| "Operationalize" / "frameworks" / "moats" | Tech-bro abstraction words | **Warn** |
| "It came back null" / "It came back X" | Passive AI-result-rhythm | **Warn** |
| Explainer gloss headings | "The system, in two pictures", "Q3 at a glance", "X, explained", "X 101", "and why it matters" | **Block** |
| Restatement | Two adjacent sentences or bullets that make the same point in nearly the same words | **Block** |

Set `DISABLE_ANTI_SLOP_HOOK=1` to bypass.

Set `DESLOP_SKIP_PATHS` to a comma-separated list of path fragments the hook should ignore, appended to the built-in skip list. Use it for content that repeats by design and is not authored prose: a personal vault's state files, a ledger directory, generated output. Example: `DESLOP_SKIP_PATHS=_archive/,_meta/ledger/`.

**Artifact gate (`hooks/artifact_slop_hook.py`, added 2026-08-31).** The two hooks above only see local file writes, so a Google Doc / Slides / Sheet created straight through the Drive connector, or a published Artifact, used to slip past. This hook closes that gap: it fires on `Artifact` and any `mcp__*__create_file` / `mcp__*__update_file`, pulls the body out of `textContent` / `base64Content` / `html` (or the Artifact's `file_path`), and runs it back through the copy and design hooks. Any block there blocks the artifact. Binary uploads (image/pdf/font) and empty/native-shell creates are no-ops. Same `DISABLE_ANTI_SLOP_HOOK=1` bypass. Note: hooks load at session start, so it protects new sessions; mid-session, self-gate by running the checks before create_file.

### 2. Manual Invocation

Use `/deslop` or ask Claude to run a slop check on any content.

### 3. Cross-Skill Integration

The design-system and brand-system skills both reference this skill. Their workflows include an anti-slop check before shipping.

## Field-observed tells (from live draft-vs-sent corrections)

Patterns caught in real usage, comparing AI drafts against what a human actually sent in the same thread. These outrank the generic lists when writing in someone's voice or for their review:

1. **Em dashes: banned outright**, not just "abuse at density." Inline separator is a plain hyphen " - ". (Global rule, all mediums.)
2. **Over-committing language.** AI drafted "locked 300 characters"; he sent "Proposing 300." Drafts must never commit the author or their company harder than verified facts: cover what's agreed, ASK the clarifying question ("Are those the 2 sessions you meant?"), never blanket-approve money/scope.
3. **Sectioned essays where numbered questions suffice.** Real pushback is 2-3 numbered questions, not 4 headed sections. ALL-CAPS asterisk headers = tell; real headers are bold sentence-case ("How we'll work"), and only when an email truly needs them.
4. **Compression that drops substance.** Cutting a real point to be short is a loss (the dropped-signatories lesson). Target: the shorter length, the full set of points.
5. **Promise-language vs act-language.** AI writes "I'll loop in Flor"; a human writes "I have already informed Flor." Act first, then reference the action.
6. **Doom warnings and public assignments in client chat.** Strip alarmism; open questions and offers, not directives naming who must do what in front of the client.
7. **Report verbosity.** Reports to a busy reader: fragments over grammar, no preamble, lead with the outcome. Repeating the ask back = slop.
8. **Duplicate artifacts.** Revising by creating a second draft/file and leaving the old one = slop workflow. Revise in place, one clean artifact.
9. **Fake completion language.** "Done/created/sent" without a tool having run. If you didn't see the tool response, it didn't happen.
10. **Bold-lead paragraph (2026-08-28).** A bold fragment used as a pseudo-title, then body prose in the same paragraph -- "**Evidence boundary.** A format-valid timestamp confirms...". Classic AI carousel/marketing tell. Drop the bold pseudo-title; just write the sentence. (Enforced in the hook, period-terminated bold only, so legit `**Label:** value` lines still pass.)
11. **Middot separators (2026-08-28).** " · " used as connective tissue ("Jan · Jul", "DBM · Open Gov"). An AI tell. Use a word, a comma, or a line break. (Enforced in the hook.)
12. **Carousel/slide furniture tells (2026-08-28).** Page-number dots ("1/10", pagination dots), upper-right kicker/eyebrow labels, and per-slide section titles all read as AI-generated deck slop. No page numbers, no eyebrow labels, no "The problem:" pseudo-headers -- let the headline carry the point.
13. **Over-titling / over-repeating (2026-08-28).** Adding a label to a slide that the headline already says, repeating the same footer descriptor on every frame, or restating the credit line twice on one slide. Say it once, in one place.
14. **Bar line under a heading (2026-08-31).** A colored horizontal rule under every section heading -- `h2{border-bottom:2px solid ...}` in CSS, an `<hr>`, or the `---` a heading border becomes when HTML converts to a Google Doc. Reads as AI section-divider furniture. Let the heading weight and the whitespace carry the break, no underline bar. (Enforced in `design_slop_hook.py`: h1-h6 with `border-bottom`, and decorative `<hr>`.)
15. **Explainer furniture (2026-09-02).** A heading that names the thing, then glosses the artifact rather than the subject: "The system, in two pictures", "Q3 at a glance", "Kindred invites, explained", "Webhooks 101", "The margin gap, and why it matters". The gloss describes the format and carries nothing the body does not. Drop it and keep the subject. Also the footer caption that re-explains the slide above it. (Enforced in the hook, narrow shapes only: a plain comma in a heading is legitimate, and "X: what changed" is a scope narrower, not a gloss.)
16. **Padding around points (2026-09-02).** The unit of cutting is the WORD, never the POINT. Half the words, all the points. A cut that removes a point is a loss, not a cut, and the point comes back at whatever length it needs. What is always free to cut: a sentence that restates the one before it, a why-it-matters preface, a format gloss, a closing recap of what was just said. All four are words with no point attached. This is the operating rule for tell #4, which governs what survives; this one governs how much room it gets.
17. **Unranked points in an argument (2026-09-02).** Two document kinds, two rules. An INVENTORY (a sweep, a brief, a portfolio roll-up, a ledger) is exhaustive and flat by design: 30 items means 30 lines, and pre-filtering is the defect. A THESIS document (a memo, proposal, decision doc, recommendation) that reads flat has not done its work: 30 points means the argument has not been found yet. Fix by surfacing the 3 that carry the decision and demoting the rest, not by deleting them. The test is "does this document argue for something?"

## Post-implementation review gate (MANDATORY)

After EVERY implementation — a feature, a document, a proposal, a design, copy, a UI — run this skill as a review BEFORE presenting the result:

1. Sweep the deliverable's user-facing surfaces: copy/microcopy, docs, UI choices, generated designs, commit-adjacent prose.
2. Apply the Universal Slop Test + the field-observed tells above + the relevant domain reference.
3. **Cut before presenting, silently.** Draft it, then cut to roughly half the words while keeping every point (tell #16). Present only the cut version. This step is never narrated, never shown as a before/after, and never mentioned. If a cut would remove a point, the point stays and the document is simply that long.
4. High-stakes (client-facing, published, or written in someone's voice) → full slop-detector agent pass.
5. Violations get FIXED, then present, never presented with a "note: might be sloppy" caveat.

This gate is part of the global feature-development protocol (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`): audit → research → plan → implement → test → fix → **slop review** → done.

## The Three Laws

1. **Specific > Generic.** If you can swap in another brand's name and the content still works, it's slop. Real content names real things — specific tools, specific numbers, specific failures, specific people.

2. **Intentional > Default.** If the answer to "why this?" is "because that's how it's usually done," it's slop. Every choice — word, color, layout, font, composition — must have a reason rooted in the brand or the message.

3. **Human > Polished.** Rough edges, personality quirks, asymmetry, and real references signal authenticity. Flawless, balanced, hedged-on-every-side content signals AI. In 2026, imperfection is premium.

## The Universal Slop Test

Before shipping ANY content — a social post, a landing page, an email, a design, an image prompt — run these five questions:

1. **"Would AI generate this by default?"** If yes, question every element.
2. **"Could this belong to any brand?"** If yes, it's not specific enough.
3. **"Is there a human fingerprint?"** A specific reference only a human would make, an imperfect choice, a voice that comes through.
4. **"Am I decorating or communicating?"** Remove decoration. Keep communication.
5. **"Would someone who knows the brand recognize this without the logo?"** If no, more brand needed.

## The Six Domains of Slop

Each domain has a dedicated reference file with full catalogs of patterns and fixes.

### 1. Copy Slop (`references/copy-slop-dictionary.md`)
The words, phrases, and sentence structures that scream "AI wrote this." Includes the banned word list, banned phrase list, structural tells (uniform paragraphs, em dash abuse, hedging), and era-specific vocabulary shifts.

### 2. Design/UI Slop (`references/design-slop-patterns.md`)
Purple gradients, unchanged component libraries, bento box abuse, default sidebar+topbar layouts, Inter font, uniform border radius, shadow soup, stock illustrations. The visual equivalent of "In today's fast-paced world."

### 3. Image Slop (`references/image-slop-tells.md`)
Plastic skin, too-perfect symmetry, oversaturated HDR, generic compositions, text rendering failures, jewelry merging into skin, uncanny valley expressions. How to spot AI images and how to prompt/edit past the tells.

### 4. Social Media Slop (`references/social-slop-patterns.md`)
LinkedIn broetry, emoji bullet points, "Agree?" closers, manufactured urgency, generic listicles, motivational quotes over AI face images. Platform-specific patterns for LinkedIn, Instagram, X/Twitter, and TikTok.

### 5. Video Slop (`references/video-slop-tells.md`)
Physics violations, object morphing, temporal flickering, hand artifacts, background drift, surface texture crawling. Detection techniques for Sora, Veo, Kling, and other generators.

### 6. Website Slop (`references/website-slop-formula.md`)
The SaaS formula (hero > logos > features > testimonials > pricing > CTA), vague aspirational headlines, gradient blob decorations, glassmorphism without purpose, the AI Purple Problem. Why AI websites convert 91% worse than quality inventory.

## Agents

### Slop Detector (`agents/slop-detector.md`)
Takes any content and audits it against all slop patterns. Returns a slop score, specific violations with references, severity ratings, and suggested fixes.

### Copy Humanizer (`agents/copy-humanizer.md`)
Takes AI-sounding copy and rewrites it: replaces banned words, varies sentence rhythm, adds specificity, removes hedging, applies brand voice from BRAND-SYSTEM.md if available.

## Workflow

### For Any Content Creation

1. **Before writing**: Check if a Brand system and/or Design system exists. These define what the brand sounds and looks like — they're the foundation that prevents slop.
2. **During creation**: The PreToolUse hook catches the most obvious copy tells automatically.
3. **Before shipping**: Run the Universal Slop Test (5 questions above). If any answer is wrong, revise.
4. **For high-stakes content**: Use the slop-detector agent for a full audit.
5. **For copy that feels off**: Use the copy-humanizer agent to rewrite.

### For Reviewing Others' Content

1. Run the slop-detector agent on the content.
2. Share the violation report with specific line references.
3. Focus on critical violations (obvious AI tells) first.
4. Don't over-correct — the goal is human, not anti-AI-for-its-own-sake.

## What Good Looks Like (`references/what-humans-do.md`)

Anti-slop is half of the equation. The other half is knowing what authentic, human-crafted content looks like across all domains. This reference covers the counter-patterns — what to do INSTEAD of the slop defaults.

## Key Rules

### Detection (What to Catch)
1. **Banned vocabulary at density.** One "leverage" is fine. Three per page is a tell. See `references/copy-slop-dictionary.md` for the full list with thresholds.
2. **Banned phrases are absolute.** "In today's fast-paced world," "It's not just X, it's Y," "Unlock the power of" — these are never acceptable. No threshold.
3. **Structural monotony kills.** Uniform paragraph length, identical sentence cadence, symmetric bullet points, consistent-length headings — AI writes at one rhythm. Humans speed up and slow down.
4. **Default choices are suspects.** Purple gradients, Inter font, sidebar+topbar, shadcn defaults, 16px radius on everything — fine IF justified by brand. Slop if chosen by default.
5. **Perfection is a tell.** Too-smooth skin, too-balanced layouts, too-hedged arguments, too-polished prose — the absence of rough edges signals AI.

### Prevention (What to Do)
6. **Specificity is the antidote.** Concrete numbers, real names, actual screenshots, specific failures, named tools. Generic = AI. Specific = human.
7. **Vary the rhythm.** Short sentence. Then a longer one that takes its time getting to the point. Then another short one. AI can't do this naturally.
8. **Earn every element.** Every paragraph, every visual, every section should justify its existence. AI generates volume; humans generate density.
9. **Show receipts.** Real data, real screenshots, real process photos, real stories. AI can generate polish; it can't generate proof.
10. **Embrace useful imperfection.** An asymmetric layout, a surprising word choice, an unexpected color — these signal "a human decided this." Don't sand down every edge.

### Integration (How This Connects)
11. **Brand is the foundation.** Most slop happens because there's no brand system to deviate from. Define the brand first (BRAND-SYSTEM.md), then slop becomes obvious because it doesn't match.
12. **Design system enforces.** Token-only values, component gating, and the "Is It Alive?" test from the design-system skill prevent UI slop at the code level.
13. **This skill audits.** Anti-slop is the quality gate that catches what the other systems miss — especially in copy, images, and content that lives outside the codebase.
